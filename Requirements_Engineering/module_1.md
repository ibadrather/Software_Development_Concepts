<hr># Module 1: Introduction to Requirements Engineering in Agile Development

## Topic 1: Definition and Importance of Requirements Engineering
Requirements engineering (RE) is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. It is a fundamental part of systems and software engineering. Requirements engineering is critical because it ensures the right product is built for the right users, serving a crucial role in preventing project failure.

### Example:
Consider a scenario where a software development team is tasked with building an online marketplace. Without a comprehensive requirements engineering process, the team might overlook key features such as a secure payment system or an intuitive product listing mechanism, resulting in a marketplace that does not meet the users' needs.

## Topic 2: The role of Requirements Engineering in Agile Development
In agile development, requirements are often referred to as "user stories" and are part of the product backlog. The Requirements Engineering process in agile involves continuous collaboration with the customer and other stakeholders. It includes activities such as requirements elicitation, documentation, analysis, validation, and management but it's done in an iterative manner aligning with the principles of Agile methodology.

### Example:
In a project using Scrum (an Agile framework), the Product Owner, who is responsible for the product backlog, will work closely with stakeholders to understand their needs and add them to the backlog as user stories. The development team then works on these stories in iterative cycles called sprints. This continuous interaction and feedback allow the team to adapt to changes swiftly and deliver a product that meets the evolving user needs.

## Topic 3: Types of requirements: Functional and Non-functional
Functional requirements are specific functionalities or system behavior that define what a system is supposed to accomplish. They describe the features and functions of the system.
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define the quality attributes, system performance, or constraints in which the system will operate. They describe how well the system performs.

### Example:
In the context of an email application:
* A functional requirement might be: "The system shall allow the user to send and receive email."

* A non-functional requirement might be: "The system shall display new emails within 2 seconds of their receipt."

## Topic 4: Requirements Engineering vs Requirements Management
While they are related, these two terms represent different aspects of working with requirements.

Requirements engineering is about the initial definition, analysis, and design of the requirements. It's about figuring out what we need to build.

Requirements management, on the other hand, is about handling changes to requirements as the project progresses, keeping track of dependencies between requirements, tracing how requirements affect different parts of the system, and making sure the agreed-upon requirements are implemented correctly.

### Case Study:
Let's look at the failure of the Denver International Airport's baggage handling system as an example. The automated baggage handling system failed catastrophically because the requirements weren't properly defined, engineered, or managed. Due to the lack of proper requirements engineering, the system was far more complex than necessary. Also, when changes were made, they weren't properly managed, leading to more confusion and issues. The project went significantly over budget and did not work as intended. This case study is a strong reminder of the importance of both requirements engineering and requirements management.
