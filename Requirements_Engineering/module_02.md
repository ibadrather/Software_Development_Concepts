# Module 2: Requirements Elicitation

## Topic 1: Understanding Requirements Elicitation
Requirements Elicitation, also known as requirements gathering, is the process of collecting information about system requirements from stakeholders, users, customers and other sources. It's a critical step in the development process, as it provides a foundation for further stages, including design, coding, testing, and deployment.

### Case Study: Building a Mobile Banking App
For example, let's imagine you're working on a mobile banking application. The requirements elicitation process would involve gathering information about what functions the app needs to have (like money transfers, bill payment, checking account balances), security requirements, user interface requirements, and so on.

## Topic 2: Techniques of Requirements Elicitation
There are several techniques that can be used for requirements elicitation, including:

### Interviews
This involves directly talking to stakeholders or potential users to gather information. This can be structured (with predefined questions) or unstructured (more like a conversation).

### Surveys
Surveys are helpful when you need to gather information from a large group of people. This can be especially useful when creating products for a broad audience.

### Document Analysis
Existing documents can provide a wealth of information about system requirements. This can include existing product specs, user manuals, maintenance logs, or even contracts.

### Prototyping
Building a prototype can be a very effective way to elicit requirements because it allows users to interact with a simplified version of the system. This can provide valuable insights into user needs and expectations.

### Example: Requirements Elicitation for a University Library System
Let's take the example of developing a new digital system for a university library. Interviews might be conducted with librarians, university staff, and students to understand their needs and expectations. Surveys might be sent out to a larger student population to gather more generalized data. Document analysis could involve looking at the existing library system's data, usage statistics, and user feedback. Finally, a simple prototype of the new system might be developed and tested with a small group of users to gather additional feedback and requirements.

## Topic 3: Elicitation Challenges and Solutions
Elicitation is not without its challenges. Some common issues include:
* Difficulty in defining system boundaries
* Conflicting requirements from different stakeholders
* Difficulty in understanding user needs

Solutions to these challenges include clearly defining the scope of the system at the start of the project, using conflict resolution techniques to manage differing stakeholder opinions, and using techniques like prototyping and user stories to better understand user needs.

## Topic 4: Stakeholder Analysis in Elicitation
Stakeholder analysis is a crucial part of the elicitation process. This involves identifying everyone who has an interest in the project (stakeholders), and understanding their needs and expectations. This can include users, customers, team members, managers, and more.

### Case Study: Stakeholder Analysis for a Hospital Management System
For example, when developing a hospital management system, stakeholders could include doctors, nurses, hospital administrators, patients, insurance companies, and more. Each of these stakeholders will have different needs and expectations (doctors might care most about accessing patient medical history, while patients might care most about booking appointments), and these need to be considered when gathering requirements.

## Sample Questions

*Can you describe your role and how you interact with the current system?

Understanding the interviewee's role and their interactions with the current system can provide context for their responses.

*What are the main challenges you face with the current system?

This question can help you identify problem areas and functionalities that need improvement.

*What are the main features you use in the current system?

This helps in understanding which features are most important and must be retained or improved in the new system.

*What features are lacking in the current system that you would like to see in the new one?

This provides insights into gaps in the current system and helps identify new requirements for the proposed system.

*Can you describe a typical use case scenario?

This helps in understanding how the user interacts with the system and what their expectations are.

*How would you prioritize these features if you had to choose?

This can assist in understanding the relative importance of various requirements.

*What performance and quality attributes are important for you?

This can help identify non-functional requirements, such as speed, usability, reliability, and security.

*What are some of the constraints that the new system should consider?

This helps uncover any legal, budgetary, or technological constraints that might affect the system.

*Are there any specific compliance or regulatory requirements we need to consider?

Especially important in industries like healthcare, finance, or other regulated sectors.

*How do you foresee the new system improving your daily work?

This can help confirm that the new system's goals align with the user's expectations.
