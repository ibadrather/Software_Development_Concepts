# Module 5: Requirements Documentation

## Topic 1: Importance of Documentation
Good requirements documentation is critical for the success of any project. It ensures that all stakeholders, including clients, managers, designers, developers, and testers, are on the same page. It serves as a reference guide, helping to prevent scope creep and misunderstandings. It also forms the basis of project planning, design, and validation efforts.

For example, suppose a development team working on a banking application does not have clear documentation about the requirements of fund transfer functionality. This might lead to inconsistencies in the implemented feature and could result in major flaws or even security issues.

## Topic 2: Requirements Specification Document
A Requirements Specification Document (RSD) outlines the expectations for a new product, service, or system. It details what the final product should do, its features, its functionality, and any constraints. It typically includes sections on functional and non-functional requirements, data requirements, system attributes, and any other specific details.

For example, an RSD for a weather application may outline the need for location-based weather forecasting, integration with different weather APIs, response time, usability, compatibility with multiple platforms, and compliance with data protection laws.

## Topic 3: Use Case Modeling
Use cases help in understanding and representing user-system interactions. They provide a user-centric view, ensuring the system serves the needs of its users. A use case diagram includes actors (users or other systems) and use cases (functionalities or interactions) the actors perform.

Let's consider a case study: a library management system. Actors could include Library Patrons, Librarians, and Suppliers. Use cases might be "Check Out Book", "Return Book", "Add New Book", "Search for Book", etc. Each use case would be described in detail, specifying the interaction between the actor and the system.

## Topic 4: User Stories
User stories are a simple, but powerful way to define the functionality of a product. Each user story should contain a type of user, what they want, and why they want it. They are an essential part of agile development and help to keep the focus on the user's needs.

An example user story for an e-commerce site might be: "As a User, I want to be able to filter products by their categories, so that I can easily find the product I need."

## Exercises
**1. Importance of Documentation:** Think about a project you have worked on in the past. What problems might have been mitigated with better requirements documentation?

**2. Requirements Specification Document:** Draft a simple RSD for a mobile application of your choice. What are its key functionalities and non-functional requirements?

**3. Use Case Modeling:** For the above mobile application, identify key actors and their interactions with the system. Draw a use case diagram.

**4. User Stories:** Write down five user stories that might be part of your mobile application. Make sure each one is from the perspective of a user and contains what they want and why.

The exercises will help reinforce the concepts you learned in this module. They will give you practical experience in documenting requirements, modeling use cases, and writing user stories.
