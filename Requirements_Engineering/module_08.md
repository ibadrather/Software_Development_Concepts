# Module 8: Writing Features and User Stories

## Topic 1: Understanding Features and User Stories
Features are a high-level service that the system needs to perform. In agile development, a feature would typically span across multiple user stories.

User stories, on the other hand, are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

<blockquote>
As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].
</blockquote>

For example:

<blockquote>
As a customer, I want shopping cart functionality so that I can review items before purchasing.
</blockquote>

The user story focuses on the experience and goals of the user, providing a simple but comprehensive view of the desired functionality.

## Topic 2: Writing Effective User Stories

An effective user story is one that captures the intent of the user and provides enough detail for the development team to implement. It should be actionable, testable, and understandable.

An effective user story follows the INVEST acronym:

* **Independent**: The story should be self-contained and able to be developed independently.

* **Negotiable**: Details can be negotiated and adjusted as needed.

* **Valuable**: It provides value to the end user.

* **Estimable**: The team can estimate the effort required.

* **Small**: It should be small enough to be completed within one sprint.

* **Testable**: Acceptance criteria can be determined.

An example of an effective user story would be:

<blockquote>
As an online customer, I want to be able to filter products by category so that I can easily find what I'm looking for.
</blockquote>

## Topic 3: Building a High-quality Backlog
A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements. A high-quality backlog typically includes the following characteristics:

* **Clearly defined**: Each user story should be clearly defined with a clear goal.
* **Prioritized**: The user stories should be ordered by business value.
* **Estimated**: The user stories should have an initial estimate of effort.
* **Emergent**: The backlog evolves over time, with items being added, deleted, or updated as necessary.

### Example:
Imagine that you're developing an online store. The backlog could include user stories like:

1. As an online customer, I want to filter products by category.
2. As a seller, I want to manage my product inventory.
3. As an online customer, I want to review products I've purchased.

## Topic 4: Collaboration with Software Teams and Hardware Experts
In an agile environment, collaboration is key. For writing effective user stories and building a high-quality backlog, regular interactions with software teams and hardware experts are crucial. These collaborations could take the form of:

* Regular backlog grooming meetings* Ad hoc discussions for clarification
* Review sessions to validate requirements

### Case Study:
A good example is the collaboration that occurred in the development of the Mars Rover. The software team had to collaborate closely with hardware experts to ensure that the software they were writing would not only control the Rover effectively but also handle the extreme conditions of Mars. This led to a better understanding of the requirements and more effective user stories, ultimately leading to the successful operation of the Mars Rover.
