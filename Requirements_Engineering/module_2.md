# Module 2: Understanding User and Application Requirements

## Topic 1: Identifying User Needs: Stakeholders and Application Specialists
One of the initial steps in the requirements engineering process is to identify and understand the needs of the users. This is done through the identification of stakeholders and consultation with application specialists. Stakeholders can be anyone who has an interest in the project or will be affected by its outcomes. In the case of a software for ZEISS electron microscopes, this could be the end-users, the technicians who maintain the equipment, the product managers, and even regulatory bodies.

Application specialists, who have deep domain knowledge, are also crucial in this process. They provide valuable insight into the practical needs of the users and can help in identifying important software features. They can also highlight any constraints or limitations that need to be considered.

For instance, a case study from a medical device software development project shows the importance of involving application specialists. Doctors, nurses, and technicians were consulted to understand the specific needs and constraints in a clinical environment. The input from these specialists was crucial in shaping the functional requirements of the software, leading to a product that was well-suited to its environment and easy for its users to adopt.

## Topic 2: Translating User Needs into Software Specifications

After identifying user needs, the next step is to translate these into concrete software specifications. These specifications describe what the software should do and can include details about functionality, performance, and constraints. This involves translating high-level user needs into more specific, detailed, and technical requirements.

As an example, let's consider the need for high-resolution imaging in the ZEISS electron microscope software. This high-level user need could be translated into several specific software specifications, such as:
* The software must support image capture at a resolution of up to 4K.
* The software must provide image enhancement functions to increase clarity.
* The software must be able to handle large image files efficiently.

## Topic 3: Concepts of ZEISS electron microscopes and ZEN software platform

Understanding the domain-specific knowledge is key in requirements engineering. In this case, one should familiarize themselves with the operation of ZEISS electron microscopes and the ZEN software platform.

ZEISS electron microscopes are used for a variety of scientific applications. The detailed understanding of its capabilities and limitations will shape the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. The ZEN software platform is a comprehensive microscopy and imaging software solution from ZEISS. Familiarity with its features, capabilities, and limitations is also critical to understand what can be built on top of it, and how it can be enhanced or extended.

## Topic 4: Interaction with Product Owners and Scrum Masters for Requirements Elicitation
Product Owners and Scrum Masters play critical roles in the agile development process. Interaction with them during requirements elicitation is crucial.

Product Owners have a thorough understanding of the product vision and can guide the team on prioritizing user needs and translating them into features and user stories. They also act as a liaison between the stakeholders and the development team.

Scrum Masters, on the other hand, can facilitate the requirements elicitation process by arranging and managing meetings, discussions, and workshops. They can help resolve any roadblocks and ensure that the team has a clear understanding of the requirements.

As an example, in an agile team developing a new feature for the ZEN software, the Product Owner might interact with stakeholders to understand their needs. They might identify that users need a more intuitive way to control the microscope's focus. The Product Owner would then bring this information to the team, where they'd discuss how to implement this in the software. The Scrum Master would facilitate these discussions and help remove any obstacles the team might encounter during the process.

Overall, this module is aimed at giving you a comprehensive understanding of how user and application requirements are identified, translated into software specifications, and how various stakeholders are involved in this process. With the help of real-world examples and case studies, you will gain practical insights into how this theory is applied in professional settings.
