## Topic 1: Introduction to Requirements Analysis
Requirements analysis is the process of reviewing user needs and generating a set of specifications that can be used to implement a system that meets those needs. It involves critical thinking and problem-solving skills to understand the requirements, translate them into a technical language, and ensure that they are clear, complete, consistent, and achievable.

**For instance**, in a project to develop a new online banking application, requirements could include: secure user authentication, fund transfer, balance checking, and account management. Analysis would involve understanding these needs in detail, such as what information is needed for user authentication, how transfers should be processed, what details are needed for balance checking, etc.

## Topic 2: Requirements Prioritization
Prioritizing requirements is a critical step that ensures the most valuable features are developed first. The MoSCoW method is a common technique for prioritizing requirements. It categorizes requirements into four types:

* **Must have**: These are critical requirements that the project cannot do without.
* **Should have**: Important but not necessary for launch.
* **Could have**: Desirable requirements that are not necessary.
* **Won't have this time**: Least-critical requirements or those that could be implemented in the future.

In the online banking application **example**, secure user authentication could be a "Must have" requirement, whereas adding a feature to categorize spending could be a "Could have" requirement.

## Topic 3: Conflict Resolution during Negotiation
Conflicts often arise during the requirements analysis phase due to differing views and interpretations of the stakeholders. It's essential to resolve these conflicts for the project to move forward. Techniques to resolve conflicts include:

* **Confrontation**: Directly address the conflict and find a solution that satisfies all parties. This approach may take time but it often provides a durable solution.
* **Compromise**: Each party gives up something to meet in the middle. This approach is quicker but the solution may not satisfy all parties fully.
* **Withdrawal**: One party withdraws their requirement. This is not an ideal solution as it may lead to resentment.

## Topic 4: Negotiation Strategies and Skills
Effective negotiation can ensure that all stakeholders are satisfied with the final requirements and that there are no major conflicts. A good negotiation strategy involves:

* **Preparation**: Understand the needs and constraints of all parties before entering negotiation.
* **Active Listening**: Listen carefully to understand other parties' viewpoints.
* **Collaboration**: Aim for a win-win solution where all parties' needs are met.
* **Flexibility**: Be willing to compromise and adapt your stance.

In the online banking application example, a conflict might arise if the marketing team wants to add an advertising feature, but the development team thinks it will compromise user experience. Through negotiation, they might agree to include a minimal, non-intrusive form of advertising.

A **case study** in requirement negotiation is the FBI's Virtual Case File system project. The project failed due to numerous issues, including a lack of clear requirements and poor negotiation. This led to conflicts, missed deadlines, and eventually, the project was scrapped after spending $170 million. This case underscores the importance of effective requirements analysis and negotiation.
