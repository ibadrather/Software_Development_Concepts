# Module 6: Requirements Management

Requirements Management is a continuous process throughout a project. It involves identifying, controlling, and tracking requirements and changes to requirements at any time as the project proceeds.

## Topic 1: Traceability in Requirements Management
Traceability in requirements management is about being able to describe and follow the life of a requirement in both a forward and backward direction.

* **Forward traceability**: Helps to find out about the system elements (e.g. design, code, test cases) that have been affected by the change in requirements.

* **Backward traceability**: Helps in understanding the origin of system elements.

### Example:
A requirement can be traced forward to design documents, source code, and test cases, and traced backward to stakeholders who proposed the requirement, and project goals it's associated with.

## Topic 2: Version Control for Requirements
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is as critical in requirements management as it is in software source code management.

### Example:
Suppose a requirement changes after the project has been initiated. Without version control, the change can create confusion about what the current and correct version is. With version control, the change can be recorded, previous versions can be referred to if needed, and all team members can be clear about which version of the requirement is current.

## Topic 3: Tools for Requirements Management
There are a variety of tools available for requirements management. These include dedicated requirements management tools such as IBM Rational DOORS, Jama Connect, and simpler tools like Atlassian Jira, and Trello.

### Case Study:
Atlassian Jira is commonly used for requirements management. Jira supports creating user stories, bugs, or tasks, and these can be organized into epics and sprints. Jira also supports version control, so changes to requirements are tracked, and previous versions can be accessed if needed.

## Topic 4: Dealing with Changing Requirements
In any software project, requirements can change for a variety of reasons. Effective requirements management must have processes in place to handle changing requirements.

### Example:
Suppose a client wants to add a new feature to their website partway through the project. The project manager would document the new requirement, assess the impact on the project schedule and costs, and then consult with the client. They might negotiate a new deadline, or the client might decide to drop a less critical feature to make room for the new one.

Please note that this is a high-level overview. For an in-depth study, consider referring to books, articles, and case studies on these topics.
